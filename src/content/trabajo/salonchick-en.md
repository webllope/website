## Web Design and Development Work

Annoyed that his wife’s gynaecologist would not disclose the results of her pap smear, Unseal’s founder Kevin came up with the idea of using the block chain to store individual health records.

Unseal approached us early in their development, having just raised funds through an ICO of their cryptocurrency PlaceboCoin. Having never worked on a web3 product we decided to farm the project out to an agency in Kyiv and skim profits off the top. Despite frequent complaints about missile strikes and power outages, the Ukrainians delivered the brief ahead of schedule.

After reaching a high of $12k, PlaceboCoin went to zero in a matter of hours. Because we took payment in PlaceboCoin but our subcontractors insisted on being paid in USD we have taken a huge financial loss on this project.

In this image we can see the last 2 months of this page, being a page that ranks very highly for local searches (specific services in Roquetas de Mar), and ranks decently for some services in Almería.

306 clicks and 7 thousand views have been achieved, all this obtained despite the fact that the service contracted with us was the most basic of just creating a website without including web positioning / SEO and that the page has only been alive for 3 months. today (05/13/2024), but we always do basic SEO that works quite well. Job well done means a happy client.
