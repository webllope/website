## Web Design and Development Work

Neoaesthetic is a beauty center in Aguadulce, Almeria that offers a wide range of services, going beyond the basics of a beauty center. They provide complex services such as HIMT, Cavitation, and Radiofrequency.

The collaboration involved the design and development of their website using **WordPress** and implementing basic SEO so that when someone searches for keywords related to their sector in their location, their page appears among the first to users.

Neoaesthetic already had a good foundation and managed their social media on their own, with 100 Google reviews and a 4.5-star rating. However, they had an outdated website with a domain they had paid for a long time ago, which we had to migrate to our premium host, significantly improving the website's response speed and completely enhancing its content.

As can be seen, according to Google itself, the page performance is 100, accessibility is 94, good practices are 100, and SEO is 100.

In this image we can see the last 3 months of this page, being a page that ranks very highly for local searches (specific services in Aguadulce), and ranks decently for some services in Almer√≠a.

410 clicks and almost 10 thousand views have been achieved, all this obtained despite the fact that the service contracted with us was the most basic of just creating a website without including web positioning / SEO, but we always do a basic SEO that works quite well. Job well done means a happy client.
