## Importance of having a business website

In today's competitive business world, having a strong **online presence** is more than necessary; it's essential. A website not only serves as a digital storefront but also provides a central platform to establish your brand identity and connect with your audience.

If any freelancer or successful company has its website, what makes you think that everyone shouldn't have one?

If you're a **local business** and most of your profit is based on the sale of physical products or services, don't think you're exempt from the need to have a website. Many users typically perform a quick online search before making a purchase, whether it's for hair salons, bakeries, restaurants, beauty centers, etc.

Any daily activity is searched online beforehand, and if your **business has a reputable website**, it can not only be accessed by users and thus gain potential customers, but Google itself is aware that your business has a website and is likely to recommend it to users before similar businesses without a web presence.

These days, small businesses tend to have [landing pages](https://www.rdstation.com/blog/es/landing-page/), as they offer incredible advantages and are incredibly affordable; you can get one starting from €200.

## Is having a website important?

Having a website is indispensable; in this section, we'll look in detail at the **advantages and utilities of having a website**.

### 5 advantages of having a website

1. **Visibility and Global Reach**: A website allows you to reach potential customers not only locally but globally. Increase your brand's visibility and expand your reach significantly.<br/><br/>For example, Juan is from Valencia and wants to go to a steakhouse, takes his phone out of his pocket, and searches on Google "Steakhouses in Valencia." If your business is not there on his screen after that search, you may have lost a customer.<br/><br/>According to [Google](https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/marketing-strategies/app-and-mobile/mobile-shoppers-consumer-decision-journey/), 82% of people check their mobile before making a physical purchase, and this influences all businesses that sell products or offer services.

2. **Credibility and Professionalism**: Having an online presence conveys professionalism and trust. Customers trust companies with a strong and accessible digital presence.

3. **Efficient Marketing**: The website acts as a powerful marketing tool. You can promote your products or services, share customer testimonials, and highlight your achievements effectively.<br/>Best of all, it's something that lasts forever; once it's done, it will remain active, **attracting new customers to your business** on a recurring basis.

4. **24/7 Accessibility**: Unlike a physical store, your website is available 24/7. This means your customers can access crucial information at any time and immediately, improving the user experience and creating an excellent impact on potential customers.

5. **Competitiveness**: In a saturated market, having a website sets you apart from the competition. Showcase your strengths, values, and what makes you unique, and you'll make a positive impression on users, leading them to prioritize your business over others without an online presence.
